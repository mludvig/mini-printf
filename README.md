mini-printf
===========

Minimal printf() implementation for embedded projects.

Motivation
----------

I was recently working on an embedded project with a STM32 MCU.
The chip had 32kB of flash memory - that's heaps for a microcontroller!
How surprised I was when the linker suddenly failed saying that
the program is too big and won't fit! How come?!

It's just some USB, I2C, GPIO, a few timers ... and snprintf()
It turned out the memory hog was indeed the glibc's snprintf() - it
took nearly 24kB out of my 32kB and left very little for my program.

Now what? I looked around the internet for some stripped down
printf() implementations but none I really liked. Then I decided
to develop my own minimal snprintf().

Here are some numbers (.bin file size of my STM32 project):

    no snprintf():      10768 bytes
    mini snprintf():    11420 bytes     (+  652 bytes)
    glibc snprintf():   34860 bytes     (+24092 bytes!!)

Why *SN*printf()?
-----------------

Why snprintf() and not printf()? Simply because there are so many
different ways to print from an embedded system that I can't really
make an universal-enough printf().

The way I chose makes printing really easy - use mini\_snprintf()
to print into a "char buffer[]" and then output that buffer to your
chip's USART, USB or network or whatever other channel you fancy.

As a by-product there's also a mini\_vsnprintf() function available.

Compatibility
-------------

I didn't implement each and every formatting sequence the glibc does.
For now only these are supported:

    %%       - print '%'
    %c       - character
    %s       - string
    %d, %u   - decimal integer
    %x, %X   - hex integer

The integer formatting also supports 0-padding up to 9 characters wide.
(no space-padding or left-aligned padding yet).

The implementation should be compatible with any GCC-based compiler.
Tested with native x86-64 gcc, arm-none-eabi-gcc and avr-gcc.

It's completely standalone without any external dependencies.

Usage
-----

1. Include "mini-printf.h" into your source files.
2. Add mini-printf.o to your objects list.
3. Use snprintf() as usual in your project.
4. Compile, Flash, Test

Etc.
